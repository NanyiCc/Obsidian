## The Amount of Liver Fat Predicts Mortality and Development of Type 2 Diabetes in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 

### Intro 
- Aims: Evaluating whether conventional histological grading of steatosis and accurate quantification of fat content in liver biopsies using stereological point counting (SPC) can predict mortality and future development of T2DM in NAFLD patients.
- Conclusion: Steatosis grade and liver fat measured with SPC predict mortality and the risk of developing T2DM in NAFLD. Reduction of liver fat decreases the risk of developing T2DM.
