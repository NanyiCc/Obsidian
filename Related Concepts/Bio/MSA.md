Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is a crucial method in the field of bioinformatics, especially in the area of protein and nucleotide sequence analysis. It's a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. These similarities could be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

For protein sequences, MSA can give valuable insights into the following:

1. **Conserved regions**: These are the regions that remain unchanged across different species or proteins. A high level of conservation often suggests these regions are functionally important.

2. **Protein families**: Proteins with similar sequences are often grouped together into "families". These proteins tend to have similar structures and functions.

3. **Evolutionary relationships**: By comparing protein sequences from different species, we can infer their evolutionary relationships. Species with more similar sequences are often more closely related.

4. **Structural information**: Even without a known 3D structure, we can often predict the structural class of a protein from multiple sequence alignments, by identifying recurring patterns.

Tools like ClustalW, T-Coffee, MUSCLE, and others are often used to perform MSA, and the process involves a scoring system to identify and optimize alignments. These scores are often based on substitution matrices (like BLOSUM or PAM) that describe the rates at which one character in a protein sequence changes to another character over time.

While useful, MSA also has challenges like dealing with sequence gaps and the complexity increases with the number of sequences and their lengths. To overcome these challenges, heuristic algorithms are often used to provide a 'good enough' solution. 

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, MSA is widely used in bioinformatics for a variety of applications such as motif finding, protein structure prediction, phylogenetic tree construction, and many others.
