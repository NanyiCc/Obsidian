SE(3)-equivariance is a concept from group theory and geometry that is often applied in various fields such as physics and computer science. The group SE(3) represents the space of 3D rotations and translations, i.e., all possible ways an object can move in 3D space without changing its shape. An operation (like a function or a neural network) is said to be SE(3)-equivariant if, when we apply an SE(3) transformation to the input (like rotating a 3D object), the output changes in the same way.

In protein modeling, the application of SE(3)-equivariance can be very useful. Protein structure is inherently 3D, and the biological function of a protein is largely determined by its 3D shape. Therefore, it makes sense to use models that understand this 3D structure. An SE(3)-equivariant model has the property that if we rotate the protein in 3D space, the model's predictions will rotate in the same way. This is a very desirable property because it means the model is not biased towards any particular orientation of the protein.

This is an area of active research as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, with several groups working on SE(3)-equivariant models for protein structure prediction and other applications. For example, in protein language models, the application of SE(3)-equivariance can help in better understanding the relationship between the sequence of amino acids (the "language" of proteins) and their 3D structure.

SE(3)-equivariant convolutional neural networks can be trained to predict properties of a protein based on its amino acid sequence, while preserving the relationship between 3D transformations of the input and output. This allows for more accurate modeling of proteins, as it aligns with the physical principles of protein structure and function.

Please note that the specific application and results could have been advanced or changed after 2021, and you may want to look for the most recent literature on this topic for the latest developments.
