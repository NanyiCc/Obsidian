Intro
关于NCDs防治的重要性：a). 涉及的人数多，死亡人数多，对社会影响巨大，且大众都关心；b). 在NCDs进行中晚期后，就需要消耗了大量的医疗资源才能控制病情且难以治愈，对病人的身体造成了更大的生理负担，同时对社会和个人家庭都造成了严重的经济负担； c). 一旦错过了早期，则治疗成功率低。因此，对NCDs进行监控预测很有必要。
目前人工智能技术在近年来取得了大量的突破，以及被各个领域积极应用并且取得了相当优秀的效果。尤其是图神经网络在各个领域都展现出了卓越的性能。由于其在处理非欧几里得数据和结构化数据的学习方面天然具有优势，因此我们认为它在医疗领域，尤其是处理电子病历中的数据一定存在着不容忽视的潜力。

**Introduction**

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) stand as a paramount challenge to global health and societal well-being. The alarming statistics around NCDs underscore their pervasive nature: a vast number of people are affected, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Such diseases not only have profound implications for the affected individuals but also ripple effects on society at large. This widespread concern among the general populace regarding NCDs is well-justified, considering the detrimental effects they engender. When NCDs progress to advanced stages, they necessitate the deployment of substantial medical resources for disease management. At these advanced stages, not only is curing the condition an arduous task, but the physiological toll on patients intensifies exponentially. This not only exacerbates the physical burden on patients but also imposes considerable financial strain on both individual families and society at large. Compounding these challenges, a missed early diagnosis often translates to reduced therapeutic success rates. As such, there is a pressing need to establish efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms for NCDs.

The realm of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a renaissance in recent years, with remarkable breakthroughs that have subsequently been harnessed across myriad sectors, yielding exceptional outcomes. Among the plethora of AI techniques, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a paragon, showcasing exemplary performance in a multitude of domains. Given GNNs' innate proficiency in handling non-Euclidean data and their adeptness at learning from structured datasets, they hold immense potential in the medical sector. We posit that their application to electronic health records (EHR) can unearth significant insights, opening new frontiers in the early detection and management of NCDs. This paper seeks to explore the untapped potential of GNNs in revolutionizing the approach towards NCDs through the lens of EHR data analysis.
